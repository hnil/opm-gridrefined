/// First cut of the dynamically / locally refinable corner-point grid -- the
/// `AdaptiveCpGrid` heir of the forest-of-octrees design
/// (docs/DESIGN-parallel-octree.md Sec.10-14, docs/REDISTRIBUTION-requirements.md).
///
/// The whole point: a refinement that the static-LGR (CARFIN) path achieves by
/// refining *at grid construction* is here achieved by building the COARSE grid
/// first and refining the marked region *after* construction -- so a deck needs
/// no initial LGR. The refined leaf is bit-for-bit the same grid the static path
/// produces (same builder, same box), hence the discretisation -- and therefore
/// the simulation -- is the same.
///
/// Representation (design Sec.10):
///   * Layer A -- the persistent macro corner-point description (dims + COORD +
///     ZCORN + ACTNUM), kept so refinement can be (re)computed from the macro
///     geometry rather than communicated.
///   * Layer B -- the derived Dune::CpGrid leaf (level zero immediately; refined
///     levels after adapt()).
///
/// This first cut is the *correctness oracle* path (design Sec.12): each adapt()
/// performs a full conforming rebuild through the existing refinement builder
/// (Opm::Refinement::ConformingBlockBuilder), the same one the static CARFIN
/// path drives. The fast in-place local adapt (append + free-list, Sec.12), the
/// factor-2 dynamic re-adapt levels (Sec.13) and the parallel root-tree
/// migration (Sec.5/14) are deliberately deferred; this class establishes the
/// mark -> adapt -> equivalent-leaf seam and proves the static/adaptive
/// equivalence.
///
/// Restrictions (inherited from the oracle builder, throw): serial; "GLOBAL"
/// parent only (no nested); marked boxes pairwise separated by >= 1 cell (no
/// touching); a single adapt() of level zero (re-adapt of an already-refined
/// grid is not implemented yet).
