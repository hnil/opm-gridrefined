/// Stage 4+6a of the build pipeline (docs/DESIGN-builder.md D4): turn one
/// block request into a fully processed refined *level grid*.
///
/// The block is resampled onto sub-pillars (refineBlock), run through the
/// corner-point preprocessor (so faults and pinch-outs inside the block are
/// matched by the same code that handles them on level zero), and equipped
/// with the parent relations the rest of CpGrid reads (father(),
/// geometryInFather(), CARFIN-local Cartesian indices).
///
/// The returned grid has level_ = levelIndex and its level_data_ptr_ bound
/// to levelStorage; the caller is responsible for placing it at position
/// levelIndex in that vector (and level zero at position 0).
///
/// @param parentGrid   The grid the parents live in (level zero for a
///                     top-level box, or an LGR level grid for a nested box).
/// @param parentDims   Cartesian dimensions of the parent description.
/// @param coord,zcorn  Parent COORD/ZCORN arrays.
/// @param actnum       Parent ACTNUM or nullptr (all active).
/// @param request      The block to refine (IJK in @p parentGrid's space).
/// @param levelIndex   Index this level grid will occupy in the hierarchy.
/// @param parentLevel  Level index of @p parentGrid (0 = GLOBAL); recorded in
///                     the child->parent relation so nested grids point at the
///                     LGR level they refine rather than always level zero.
/// @param levelStorage The hierarchy vector the grid will live in.
/// @param comm         Communicator for the new grid object.
/// @param outRefined   If non-null, receives the resampled refined corner-point
///                     description of this level (its own children, if any, are
///                     refined from it).
