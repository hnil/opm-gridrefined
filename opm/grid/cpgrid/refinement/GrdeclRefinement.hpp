/// Semantics are corner-point-native (what ECLIPSE LGRs mean):
///  - Sub-pillars are straight lines whose endpoints interpolate the four
///    surrounding parent pillar endpoints bilinearly; refined pillars on
///    parent pillar positions reproduce the parent pillars exactly.
///  - Refined zcorn values interpolate the parent cell's eight zcorn values
///    trilinearly in the lateral/vertical fractions.
///
/// Faults and pinch-outs *inside* the block survive by construction: zcorn
/// jumps across columns and collapsed cells resample to jumps/collapses on
/// the refined lattice; matching them into faces is the (later) processing
/// stage's job. Note that on inclined pillars this differs slightly from
/// refining each hexahedron by its trilinear map (the old CpGrid approach);
/// on vertical pillars the two coincide exactly.
///
